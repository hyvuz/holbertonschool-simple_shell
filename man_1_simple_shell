.TH HSH 1 "April 2025" "1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
hsh \- A simple Unix shell clone for educational purposes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ file ]
.br
Reads commands either interactively from standard input or from a file if provided.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a minimalistic Unix shell developed to emulate basic shell behavior. It supports both
interactive and non-interactive modes, allowing users to execute commands, including some built-in commands.

In
.B interactive mode,
the shell prompts the user to input commands line-by-line.

In
.B non-interactive mode,
commands are read from a file or piped from another command.

This shell is built as part of a software engineering curriculum to demonstrate the inner workings of command interpreters using C and system calls.

.SH COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are supported:
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell with the given status. If no status is provided, exits with the status of the last command.

.TP
.B env
Displays the current environment variables.

.SH OPTIONS
There are no command-line options supported. The shell can only accept an optional script
.IR file
to read commands from.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Run the shell interactively:
.B
$ ./hsh
.br
($) ls -l
.br
($) exit

.TP
Run a single command via piping (non-interactive):
.B
$ echo "ls -1" | ./hsh

.TP
Execute a script of commands:
.B
$ cat commands.txt
.br
ls -l
.br
env
.br
$ ./hsh commands.txt

.TP
Attempt to run an unsupported command:
.B
$ echo "foobar" | ./hsh
.br
./hsh: 1: foobar: not found

.SH LIMITATIONS
hsh is intended for educational purposes and is not feature-complete. It does not currently support:
.RS
\- Advanced features like piping, redirection, or command history
.br
\- Aliases or shell scripting constructs (e.g., if, while, functions)
.br
\- User customization files like .bashrc
.br
\- Background process execution (&)
.RE

These limitations are intentional, as
.B hsh
was developed to reinforce core Unix system concepts including process management and environment handling.
